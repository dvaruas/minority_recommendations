\chapter{Analyzing Synthetic Data}
Here we provide additional visualizations which we generated for the purpose of our thesis for synthetic data analysis of \textit{growing networks} in section \ref{growing_networks}.

As we have detailed in algorithm \ref{growing_network_model}, we grow the synthetic networks for $t(=10000)$ iterations in our experiments for \textit{Growing Networks}. We visualize the change in count of minority and majority nodes in the recommendation list of length $k(=5)$ for recommendations to minority and majority nodes with progress in time. The iteration step-size considered for these plots is 1000.

Also for the \textit{reinforcement methods} we only provide the results for the ranking factor $r=1.0$ in the results section for \textit{growing networks}. Here we provide the additional plots for the ranking factor values of $r=\{0.0, 0.5\}$ for the \textit{Ranked-Bandit} and \textit{Top-Rank} recommender methods.
