\section{Research Questions}

We wish to explore the following research questions in this thesis - 

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item[RQ1] For a given network, how the different group of nodes in the network rank among themselves when trained using a agent learning to rank, using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. \\
	
	\item[RQ2] Perform case studies for the existing real-world network data to see the ranking effects in them
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Facebook100 dataset \cite{traud2012social} contains a large collection of students from 100 colleges in Facebook which was collected in 2005.
		
		\item The Google+ dataset from \cite{leskovec2012learning} containing information for 107,614 users. \\
	\end{enumerate} 

	\item[RQ3] How the structural characteristics of a network like degree distribution, growth and minority ranking are affected for a network generated with respect to varying homophily and minority sizes, by using recommender algorithms for network growth. This is studied in 2 different aspects - 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The network grows using algorithms like Random-Walk and Adamic-Adar index whose customized variants are used currently in real-world social recommender systems. 
		
		\item The network grows using recommender systems which use Reinforcement Learning for ranking nodes for recommendation. \\
		
	\end{enumerate} 
	
	\item[RQ4] How to train or reinforce learning agents to mitigate bias in ranking of minorities.
	
\end{enumerate}
